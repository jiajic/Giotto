\item{feat_type}{feature type for which the enrichment information was
calculated}

\item{enrichment_name}{name of the spatial enrichment

\description{
findCellTypesFromEnrichment
}
\details{
This function returns a two-column matrix, one column
will contain cell IDs and the other will contain the
most likely cell type based on the provided enrichment.

By setting return_frequency_table to TRUE, a table
will instead be returned. This table will detail
the number of occurences for each cell type, based on
the provided enrichment.

The cell types are assigned by determining the maximum
value of the z-score or -log10(p-value) for a cell and
the associated cell types from the enrichment.
