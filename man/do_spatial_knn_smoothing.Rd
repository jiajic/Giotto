\usage{
do_spatial_knn_smoothing(
  expression_matrix,
  spatial_network,
  subset_feats = NULL,
  b = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expression_matrix}{gene expression values to use}

\item{spatial_network}{spatial network to use}

\item{subset_feats}{subset of features to use}

\item{b}{smoothing factor beteen 0 and 1 (default: automatic)}
}
\value{
matrix with smoothened gene expression values based on kNN
spatial network
}
\description{
smooth gene expression over a kNN spatial network
}
\details{
This function will smoothen the gene expression values per cell
according to its neighbors in the selected spatial network. \cr
b is a smoothening factor that defaults to 1 - 1/k, where k is the median
number of k-neighbors in the selected spatial network. Setting b = 0 means
no smoothing and b = 1 means no contribution from its own expression.
